# Blockchain-Based Drug Traceability System

# Overview

This project is a Blockchain-Based Drug Traceability System designed to prevent counterfeit drugs and enhance transparency in the pharmaceutical supply chain. By leveraging permissioned blockchain technology, this system ensures that every stage of a drugâ€™s lifecycle, from manufacturing to distribution and retail, is securely recorded and verified.

# Features

Permissioned Blockchain: Only verified participants (e.g., manufacturers, distributors, retailers) can access and interact with the system.

- Smart Contracts: Automates key processes such as drug registration, transfer, and verification.

- Immutable Ledger: Provides a tamper-proof record of transactions, ensuring authenticity.

- Scalability: Supports high transaction volumes with optimized consensus mechanisms.

- Regulatory Compliance: Adheres to pharmaceutical industry standards to ensure safety and legal compliance.

# Technologies Used

- Blockchain Platform: Hyperledger Fabric / Ethereum (configurable based on enterprise needs)

- Smart Contracts: Solidity (for Ethereum) / Chaincode (for Hyperledger Fabric)

- Programming Languages: JavaScript, Solidity

- Database: IPFS for decentralized storage (if applicable)

- Development Tools: Truffle, Ganache, Remix, Hyperledger Fabric SDK

# Installation & Setup

Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (for running backend services)

- Truffle & Ganache (if using Ethereum)

- Docker & Docker Compose (if using Hyperledger Fabric)

- Metamask (for Ethereum-based deployments)

# Steps to Run the Project

1. Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/drug-traceability-blockchain.git
cd drug-traceability-blockchain

2. Install Dependencies

npm install

3. Start the Blockchain Network

For Ethereum (Ganache):

ganache-cli -d

For Hyperledger Fabric:

docker-compose -f docker-compose.yaml up -d

4. Compile and Deploy Smart Contracts

For Ethereum:

truffle compile
truffle migrate --network development

For Hyperledger Fabric:

./scripts/deployChaincode.sh

5. Run the Application

npm start

# Smart Contract Structure

The smart contracts govern the registration, transfer, and verification of drugs in the supply chain.

# Key Smart Contract Functions:

- registerDrug(): Manufacturer registers a new drug batch.

- distributeDrug(): Transfers the drug batch to a distributor.

- verifyDrug(): Confirms the authenticity of the drug before purchase.


# Challenges Faced & Solutions

1. Data Integration with Legacy Systems

Challenge: Many pharmaceutical companies rely on legacy systems that are not blockchain-compatible.
Solution: Developed APIs and middleware to bridge blockchain and legacy databases.

2. Ensuring Scalability

Challenge: High transaction volumes require optimization.
Solution: Implemented sharding techniques and layer-2 solutions.

3. Regulatory Compliance

Challenge: Compliance with FDA and global regulations.
Solution: Designed smart contracts to align with pharmaceutical regulatory standards.

Future Enhancements

AI-powered Analytics: Predict counterfeit risks using machine learning models.

Cross-chain Interoperability: Enable integration with other blockchain networks.

Real-time Alerts: Notify stakeholders of suspicious drug transactions.
