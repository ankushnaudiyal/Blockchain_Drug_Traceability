# Blockchain-Based Drug Traceability System

# Overview

This project is a Blockchain-Based Drug Traceability System designed to prevent counterfeit drugs and enhance transparency in the pharmaceutical supply chain. By leveraging permissioned blockchain technology, this system ensures that every stage of a drugâ€™s lifecycle, from manufacturing to distribution and retail, is securely recorded and verified.

# Features

Permissioned Blockchain: Only verified participants (e.g., manufacturers, distributors, retailers) can access and interact with the system.

- Smart Contracts: Automates key processes such as drug registration, transfer, and verification.

- Immutable Ledger: Provides a tamper-proof record of transactions, ensuring authenticity.

- Scalability: Supports high transaction volumes with optimized consensus mechanisms.

- Regulatory Compliance: Adheres to pharmaceutical industry standards to ensure safety and legal compliance.

# Technologies Used

- Blockchain Platform: Hyperledger Fabric / Ethereum (configurable based on enterprise needs)

- Smart Contracts: Solidity (for Ethereum) / Chaincode (for Hyperledger Fabric)

- Programming Languages: JavaScript, Solidity

- Database: IPFS for decentralized storage (if applicable)

- Development Tools: Truffle, Ganache, Remix, Hyperledger Fabric SDK
